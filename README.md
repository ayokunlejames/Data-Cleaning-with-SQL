# Data-Cleaning-with-SQL

In this project, I cleaned up the Nashville Housing Dataset using PostgreSQL. I downloaded the dataset from a [Github repository](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx) as a .xlsx file. I converted it to a csv file (UTF 8) and imported the dataset into PostgreSQL GUI (PgAdmin) using the Import/Export feature after creating the table in SQL. 

This project shows data wrangling & cleaning skills, and knowledge of key SQL functions. The code for creating the table and cleaning the data are linked in this repo.
