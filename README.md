# Data-Cleaning-with-SQL
Data Cleaning project using PostgreSQL
In this project, I cleaned up the Nashville Housing Dataset using PostgreSQL. I downloaded the dataset from a Github repository as a .xlsx file, I converted it to a csv file (UTF 8) and imported the dataset into PostgreSQL GUI (PgAdmin) using the Import/Export feature after creating the table in SQL. This project shows data wrangling & cleaning skills, and knowledge of key SQL functions. The code for creating the table and cleaning the data are linked in this repo.
